## Credits
[Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc2olxLgKLk) taught me how to stick my footer to the bottom of the webpage regardless of document content!

[W3Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) helped me find an accessibility error in my contact `<form>`

[w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_textarea_cols.asp) taught me how to add more rows to my `<textarea>`

[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) provided the tools I needed to test my webpages for accessibility

[MDN Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute) taught me how to utilzie the `aria-describedby` attribute!

[web.dev](https://web.dev/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools) provided explanation why I should add `rel="noreferrer"` for added security to my `<a>` with `target="_blank"`!
